Before running this code, make sure to set the following environment variables:

- <details><summary>TMI_TOKEN: Your bot's Twitch OAuth token (starts with "oauth:")</summary>
<p>

The TMI_TOKEN is an OAuth token used to authenticate your bot with Twitch's chat servers. To generate the TMI_TOKEN for your Twitch bot, follow these steps:

Go to the Twitch Token Generator: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
Click "Connect" and log in with your Twitch bot account (not your personal account). This is the separate account you created specifically for your bot.
Authorize the requested permissions. The minimum required permissions for a chat bot are usually "chat:read" and "chat:edit". However, you can select additional permissions based on your bot's functionality.
After authorizing, you will be redirected to a page with your generated TMI token. The token will start with "oauth:" followed by a series of characters (e.g., oauth:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890).
Keep your TMI token secure, as it is used to authenticate your bot and perform actions on your behalf. Do not share it publicly or include it directly in your code. Instead, store it as an environment variable or in a secure configuration file.

When setting up your Twitch bot, use the TMI token as the value for the TMI_TOKEN environment variable in the code example provided earlier. This will authenticate your bot when connecting to Twitch chat.

</details>

- CLIENT_ID: Your Twitch application's Client ID
- BOT_NICK: Your bot's Twitch username (the account you created for your bot)
- BOT_PREFIX: The prefix for your bot's commands (e.g., "!")
- CHANNEL_NAME: The Twitch channel you want the bot to join

You can set environment variables using a .env file and the python-dotenv library, or set them directly in your system or hosting environment.

This example connects to Twitch and listens for messages, but it doesn't handle any commands yet. To add command handling, you can define command functions within the TwitchBot class using the @commands.command() decorator. For example:

```
@commands.command(name='hello')
async def hello_command(self, ctx):
    await ctx.send(f'Hello, {ctx.author.name}!')
```

This command would respond with "Hello, [username]!" whenever a user types "!hello" in the chat.

Before running this code, ensure that you've set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenAI API key. You can find this key in your OpenAI account.

This example adds a new "!ask" command, which users can use to ask questions to ChatGPT. For example, a user can type "!ask What is the capital of France?" in the chat, and the bot will respond with the answer.

You may need to adjust the parameters for the openai.Completion.create() function depending on your requirements. This example uses the "text-davinci-002" model engine, but you can replace it with another engine if desired.
