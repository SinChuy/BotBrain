Before running this code, make sure to set the following environment variables:

TMI_TOKEN: Your bot's Twitch OAuth token (starts with "oauth:")
CLIENT_ID: Your Twitch application's Client ID
BOT_NICK: Your bot's Twitch username (the account you created for your bot)
BOT_PREFIX: The prefix for your bot's commands (e.g., "!")
CHANNEL_NAME: The Twitch channel you want the bot to join
You can set environment variables using a .env file and the python-dotenv library, or set them directly in your system or hosting environment.

This example connects to Twitch and listens for messages, but it doesn't handle any commands yet. To add command handling, you can define command functions within the TwitchBot class using the @commands.command() decorator. For example:

@commands.command(name='hello')
async def hello_command(self, ctx):
    await ctx.send(f'Hello, {ctx.author.name}!')


This command would respond with "Hello, [username]!" whenever a user types "!hello" in the chat.

Before running this code, ensure that you've set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenAI API key. You can find this key in your OpenAI account.

This example adds a new "!ask" command, which users can use to ask questions to ChatGPT. For example, a user can type "!ask What is the capital of France?" in the chat, and the bot will respond with the answer.

You may need to adjust the parameters for the openai.Completion.create() function depending on your requirements. This example uses the "text-davinci-002" model engine, but you can replace it with another engine if desired.
